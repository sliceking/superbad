## Its a lot of work

But I feel so satisfied. Working my body like this is really a cure all for me. For the past week and some change my 
hours have been around 6-7 a day and today I think was the first time I did more than 8. 10 total. I've been watching
the national team and managers do 12 hour days for the past couple weeks and see how its taken a toll on them. I think 
I'm capable of doing those hard weeks, back to back, trying to get everyone up to speed. It sounds like fun to me. Right
now I'm learning a position called Set, Its like the expo for the front of the house and its a lot of work. A lot more
compared to the drive thru or register. Drive thru is like a little separate heaven where the madness doesn't touch. 
Sometimes you'll get weirdos at the window but thats not that bad. The management staff is a bit wild. Theres some good
bosses and some anxious ones and some that are probably just plain bad. I wonder what Andrew thinks about how things are
going so far. I wish there was time to sit and talk with him but I dont think there is. Culver's life is busy. Maybe one
day he'll get someone to GM the place for him and then he'll have time for other things, but from what I've seen of him
so far I think he's a good boss. 

## Margos birthday

Tomorrow is Halloween/Margaret's birthday. I need to find a costume and settle on songs to sing at karaoke. I'm gonna be 
wiped out tomorrow from work, then evening shenanigans and then work the next day. Saturday I'll have off and get to 
spend the day with Shelley and co. at Zilker and that sounds amazing. I feel guilty when I dont have stuff planned for 
my days off now. Doing meeting service at NKC has come to a halt because of the work, but thats ok I'll find some other
meeting to go to for a while.
