## Day Stay.

I'm lucky to have good friends that have the ability to help my stupid self. Being able to get away for 5 days and cat-sit daphane in a nice house, next to the airport- is a godsend. Apply to real jobs, build my corner of the internet, get away from this wild offense-defense game my mom wants to play. This morning, I think she was trying to tell me she let everything go after sleeping (she was doing a lot of general yelling yesterday) but then wanted me to feel bad because shes 75. When I asked about what she meant and wanted me to do, she started muttering. She doesnt really want to talk about anything, I think she wants to vent. I know she wants better and deeper and real relationships, but I think she doesnt understand that the way you get there is by talking honestly. 

Gotta pack a couple days worth of clothes and supplies to bring to Margos. She said she bought some groceries for me <3, I am so lucky. Ive been a lazy crum bum for a while now though and cant let things like my relationship with my mom get in the way of me rebuilding some semblance of a life. Naievely though, I still feel like theres some set of framing, explaining, logic, that would get my mom to understand.
