## I have too many expectations of my mom

Shes getting old and her judgement is beginning to go. The other month she was sure she'd been texting Elon Musk and he
was waiting on her gift cards so he could finish delivering a Tesla and 100K to her. Part of me is fighting with her, 
trying to reason things out with her to show her how to watch out for traps like this. Another part is fighting reality,
I don't want to admit that her thinking is so compromised. That its just going to get harder for her to understand me.
She's doing it too, she's fighting the fact she's going to die, that her thinking has gotten worse, constantly telling 
herself she's not as bad as someone else in the Assisted Living Facility. It must be terrible to be in your 70s and be 
afraid of death and aging. Knowing that your father and sister suffered from dementia and that you are next in line. If 
I don't think about it then its not happening. I wish that were the case. I wish I could do something to remove her 
insecurities, find her some friends, stop her from judging herself and others. She's been alone too long and her pride 
is being used to keep her ego afloat. I can just try to show her I love her, even though she won't understand it.
