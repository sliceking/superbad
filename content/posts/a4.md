## Day 4. All clear.

Reading, coffee shops. ok. games. lets get cracking. gotta show up every day with a schedule. I still have access to the teamworx and I can see the schedules from the burger mines. Maya is still on the schedule! I feel like the little respect I had for that place has shrunk! Wow, its so small. Short people, amirite? So silly. Good luck guys, you're gonna need it. Jira or trello would help you all get on the same page and have a source of truth, but post-it project management is the horse that got you to the table and you're ride or die. Yee haw! I do have my spiteful cheeriness about leaving and it is childish and low to find bits of joy- imagining those poor unfortunate souls doing truck or the shift change form, but I do wish them all good futures and to do well. Even Maya and Alexis, at times. They're set on making life rough and I can't help with that. 

Getting older puts a lot of things into perspective. In 10 years how much will my philosophy change? Standup, reading, programing, exercise. Lets go.
