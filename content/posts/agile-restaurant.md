## How can I get them to change

what i want is a restaurant where i can count on each employee and rely on their honesty and openness. right now that is
a far off goal but there are a few people i can count on, i need to highlight their successes and give more responsibility
to the people who are doing good and put the rest of them on the right track. i need to correct the problem people and
if they are unable to comply, then reprimand them. A big part of the problem is kitchen culture has been tainted by 
damions corner cutting and past influence and people like melanie who uses her team trainer title as a license to be a
lazy piece of shit. the only data point i have is when andrew and i ran a lunch successfully and the only thing i did
different is have a little foh meeting where i talked about today everyone is doing everything and needs to focus. 
So I'm going to try to run morning standups when I can, do office work all week and learn fryer and middle. Coach
Brittany and Jamar when I can because their problems are emotional and I have a bit of experience with that.
