## Betrayal and character assassination

Why do people punish themselves? Pride. Sometimes in weird places, sometimes in obvious ones. Write from the scar, not 
from the wound. Itll be too emotional if its from an open wound. Thats pretty good advice. Getting away for a few days
is great to reflect and figure out what I'm doing with myself. Its been a lot of nothing, starving, depression. Not good.
Having someone to yell at you and rile you up is a strange bonus. I can use any negative feelings as fuel to get things
done, but I've been trying to avoid that for a while. Can't I find enough positive emotions to use as a motivation
source? It doesnt look like it, at least not right now. It was a decent experiment.
