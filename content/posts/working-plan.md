## I think this is the thing to do

I haven't had a job for over a year and I think Culver's just hired me. This is going to be an interesting ride. I 
remember feeling a kind of pride for not having worked a fast food job in the past. Is this a success? It doesn't feel
like it. This is going to be a wide cast of characters, kids in high school, 60 year olds, lots of attitudes and hungry
grumps. Good thing I have access to emotions like anger and frustration again. Typically, I'm a very patient person and
this doesn't feel like it will be a problem, but I don't know everything, and I've been wrong before. Having something
to do while getting my programming chops back is a benefit and I suppose that is a victory. The past year has been a
lot of emotions and stagnation. An inability to move anything. This is movement. That's good. It's something.

I'm not sure if I'll be talking to him again. He knows he has a big ego, but from my perspective it doesn't feel like
he's doing a lot to kill it. I know this isn't true and I about wonder what he was like before this period in his life.
I've gotten tired of him patting himself on the back every time he tells a story.

Let it go! If you're a bad story detector you won't find any good ones. You're avoiding talking about the failures, the 
real emotional failures and you're in no way a martyr you just love telling yourself that you are. There are no bombers
that are scared of you, pure delusion, and stop talking shit about everyone after a meeting. They talked about what they
needed to, stop judging them. If there was a real after-meeting with a caring environment, instead of telling some girl 
to shut the fuck up and acceptance and higher power everything - That would help. Lying about how you're feeling until
you're better, doesn't. People kill themselves from not having an honest emotional outlet. Doing a sharetime performance
gets you nowhere. If you don't say all the buzzwords you're supposed to I'll look down on you from 30 years of 
doing things my own way. You don't get to choose, everyone is a statesman **_AND_** a deacon. The listeners decide.
