## Day 7. Burger mines.

Took the day off. Lots of people did. 9 shifts called out. I think Andrew is upset. He wants me to pick up some lids from round rock tomorrow morning, which is fine. He said I'm putting things just everywhere, which doesn't feel like its true. He might be upset at me, which also feels unwarranted but I suppose we'll talk about it a bit tomorrow. Maybe, maybe not. Maybe tomorrow I quit. Thats ok too. The mine feels cold and tapped. There is not a lot of motivation and I think resentments might be too high to do anything. Things to keep in mind during the talk. 
Andrew has been rude at me. I have not been rude at him.  
Feels like the assumption is I haven't done what he asks or trying to do it poorly.
I am the only person taking cleaning and being guest focused seriously.
I do the truck when I am sick and get penalized for it.
I have no truck support.
I have no shift change work support. 
I am always busy and constantly getting things done.
