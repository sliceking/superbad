## Day 6. Burger mines.

Stomach is bad. Woke up and had 3 bad shits. Did truck. Weak. Ted asked me to not vape on the way in from running orders, I was expecting this eventually and I think he was a bit nervous about it. He called in the evening but I was already going to sleep from not eating all day and then eating and getting hit with a food coma. I did pretty much the whole shift change by myself again. I was getting aggrivated towards the end of the day. Aydin has been on middle and doing pretty good. He got kinda pissed today about builds being out of order, which feels kind of like him acting how everyone else acts. When the pressure is on back there he has anger bursts to deal with it- not great. Also he was starting to talk about being upset with Tammy not getting things right in prep. He doesn't want to have the conversation with her because he doesn't want to be "mean". He's gonna be ok. I do worry about the fatal five - aydin, skyler, maya, alexis, emily. Emily doesnt really count but the rest of them are not great as an out of work group. Theyre going to get themselves in trouble Maya and Alexis are troublemakers. Its not gonna go good.
