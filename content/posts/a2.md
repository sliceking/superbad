## Day 2. All clear.

Haircut, working out, leetcode, reading, applications. Its weird to have motivation behind me. Maybe thats what working at the fast food place was about. The motivation of 'ill show you' has always been a strong force in my life until it was absent. Depression and addiction had pretty intense effects on my will to succeed. At Culvers I did find motivation to work hard, outpace my peers, know my worth and confidence. Bringing that into the next thing I do is a welcomed feeling. I have the time and the outlook of building/creating something interesting and inspiring.
