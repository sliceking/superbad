## Being a passenger? Sometimes.

Its like I'm watching myself go down a bad spiral. Watching myself upset the world and people around me. Waiting. For some divine spark to come down and help me push through all the bad decisions I've accumulated. I want to give up. The drive to start to make things better just isnt there. Its there sometimes, but barely. I really need to work out. This is what happens to me when I dont work out. Things just arent screwed on tightly enough, all the bad thoughts are coming in. If I had the option of being snapped out of existance, Thanos style, I would pick that. When I can workout, sleep properly, eat properly, I will feel like I can take on anything. Like I am capable and competent.
