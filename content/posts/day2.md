## Day 2. Burger mines.

Aydin, Skyler, Emily, Maya and Alexis decided to do a bunch of mushrooms and head to sixth street the other day. Maya called out and aparrently she also couldnt handle it and bailed on their get together. Ego death is not fun if youre not ready for it, and she strikes me as a person that lies to herself quite a lot to get through the day. Mostly a terrible person. Emily was the DD and Aydin sounds like he didnt sleep at all and him and skyler went a bit overboard with shots, coke and whatever else they could find out in the wild. This path for Aydin scares me because I see a lot of myself in him, and he's had a pretty good streak sober - this is a terrible idea for him to hang out with them more. I think he will be hanging out with them more though. He's too young and still has to fall into more pits before he has enough experience of failure to make those choices that are good for him but less "fun". 

I hope Maya gets fired. She is unnecessary. I hope Alexis get fired. She is a decent worker but she wants to cause trouble with a bunch of the managers. I feel like she has daddy issues or something of the sort. Very set on being combative with any males with authority. She's only 18, probably has an eating disorder, and very rude at times.
