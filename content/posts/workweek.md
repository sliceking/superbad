## What was the problem?

Where was my drive to do anything? It was gone for about a year and now in a week its fallen into an appropriate position.
The only change was picking up a fast food job, which at first felt like a failure. But now it feels great, amazing
even. I can't remember a time when I didn't care about my job at all in this way. Not the way of "I dont care about it
so I won't try to achieve", but I don't have any fear about the work, the people, any interaction. Any anxieties have
been replaced with a soaring confidence. The work is not difficult. I've managed to find a way to have fun in the 
monotony and improve on parts of myself that I'd been neglecting. The job feels like a project. A side quest. Something
for the thrill of the experience. Which is a pretty good way to frame it. It would be so easy to judge myself as a failure
and the fast food job as proof. But I've done that a thousand times already. The past year of living in the void was
enough time to beat myself to death and then try not to. I'll start with a slackbot to help people reschedule shifts. 
And then if they like that, maybe theres other little things I can do to make the place better. Its so weird. I used
to have a bit of pride that I didn't work a fast food job. That didn't help much of anything though.
