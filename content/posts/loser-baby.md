## Can it work? Will people change? Will I change? I've had enough.

Its mental. I've done it again, nicotined my way into a pit. Definite pit. I know the way out, its a few days of feeling crazy and then its alright. Rewire my brain to food and exercise and then be productive and happy and a real person. Instead of pretending to program my way to success with Godot tutorials and foot half out the door.

Brittany is starting to be whiny and snippy with me, which is something I knew would happen eventually. The way she acts with everyone is a way shell eventually act with me. It came from me calling out on saturday. She wrote this big old thing in slack with multiple things that said, not you stanley- which ok, i understand what youre trying to do but there were parts directly about me in there. I defended myself a bit and the message was deleted(?) I dont think things at work are going to get much better soon, but you know what - IM GONNA TRY. Her and Jamar are very similar with their insecurity and people picking abilities.

QUIT VAPING, MAKE THE STUPID GAME, FIX THE RESTAURANT.

I'm not allowed to wipe trays or tables anymore so I have to make other people do it. I think there are some other limitations I can put on myself to be a better manager. I cant change the ketchup or do trash.
