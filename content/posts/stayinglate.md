## People come and people go
I feel like theres been a few people that have been let go and a few that have quit. I think one person walked out this
evening. Its not a bad job, its really fun. I think the manager staff is a little new at the game though. Its their first
time being in charge and they have an idea of how they want to manage but dont know how to do it. Most likely, none of 
them have ever had a good boss before, so they dont know what that feels like and dont have an idea of how to get there. 
Sometimes I give little pep talks to them, but I'm not sure if that helps. I'm in an odd position, im just a worker, 
nobody bothers me, nothing bothers me, I do whats expected and fill my time with useful tasks, seek out new tasks and 
information and ways to help, and do that. I know I'm probably older than all the managers and I suppose that gets me 
some respect? I'm not sure how I fit into the picture, I train people on stations, I try to be a good role model. This
isn't hard, especially since I've used the past year to straighten a lot of my life out by going to meetings and working
on myself.

## React
This week I want to start a project using react. The dreaded react I've been avoiding for years. Getting a programming
job I feel like would be easier if I did some of that. I just need to get the ball rolling again.
