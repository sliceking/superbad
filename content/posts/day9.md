## Day 9. Burger mines.

The burger mines have been shut. Maya is a problem person and this morning the fudge and caramel heaters were in different places, unplugged. She didnt want to plug them in. I had to bug her a bunch of times to do it. She didnt want to do it because she had to move a fridge. I complained in the manager chat about it. She came crying and argumentative about it and then started to criticize me. After things settled down Ted wanted to jump in and say something about the plugs. That was enough to make me leave. Andrew called and I ignored the call. He sent a kind of aggressive text a little later about the key and I said its not a problem for me to give the key. Then he said sorry to see me go and I said I'm sorry to go too. People are rude and I have my limit.

I took a walk by the blue dot. Thought about things. I wasnt sure if I was going to go back to work or not before Andrew texted. There were so many opportunities for him to be polite, same with everyone else. We have a couple of new good people there but that doesn't matter anymore. I was a little happy thinking about them crashing without me. About them trying to do truck tomorrow. About the amount of work they will need to fill with me gone. In terms of physical work, without question, I did the most. Mostly because the truck is a lot of work, but also, nobody else is moving 10 miles a day, even the explicit food runners.

I feel bad for them. They have a lot of tough things they need to do to be successful and the team is not equipped with the correct set of honesty and capability. But now I do have plenty of motivation to get a real job. This was a fun experiment. I got to walk out of a job. That was interesting. That place has a history of people walking out and its not hard to understand why. 

They have a manager meeting and a book club meeting tomorrow, which I am a little sad I'll miss. It's also scheduled on truck day which is a bit... shitty. If I were there I was supposed to do truck and do the meeting? Thanks a lot. Aydin has to travel an hour just to be at the meeting for a couple hours which sucks. Theres all these little problems I dont have to worry about anymore and it is refreshing. I can tidy up myself without having to worry about the soul sucking slop of a crew to tarnish my good vibes. Lets go through the list of memorable people for fun.

Maya- garbage person. Under 20, has a kid, constantly out of uniform because of her nails. Entitled and general piece of shit. Good at making guests never come back because of her napoleon/chihuahua demeanor.

Alexis- garbage person. Under 20, concerned with partying, anorexia, jealousy and daddy issues. Every male manager is a target for her to be a problem with and then play some form of emotional games. 

Ted- plays 38 laws of power and every word he speaks has to be a hero story with him as the hero. Not bad but also not genuine. Does do a lot of hours.

Brittany- Nice person, very sweet, troubled life and cant contain her frustrations. Lots of outbursts of anger.

Carrion- Keeps himself entertained by frustrating other people. Troublemaker and harmless. Really wants other people to know he's black even though he doesnt look like it.

Zach- Nice guy, white knight.

Aydin- Young, ex addict, k rage, fun joker, about to go down a bad path by hanging out with party people. 

Skyler- the drunk, party guy, heart of gold but also heart of hangover. You dont know if you're gonna get jolly or negative hangover skyler every shift. Has a lot of negative things to say when hes in down mode. 

Charles- ching chong charles. very white, super long hair, quiet, eyes are close together. Looks weird without his glasses.

Tammy- nice lady, anxious, kind of a bumbling person. 

Evelina- Nice person, quiet, does work.

Madison- Nice person, quiet, does work. 

Emily- Jolly and fun, polite. 

Erika- Nice person, does work, sharp.

Jamar- Nice guy, alcoholic, wants to be a comedian but has never done standup. Thinks people dont respect him and tries to use anger to try and get it. 

Andrew- nice guy, doesnt really want to be the leader. too forgiving. 

PAST PEOPLE

Melanie- The worst person. Caused so much drama, fat, lazy, talked tons of shit. I think first team fire. 

Damion- Kitchen manager, not good with people. Liked to aggrivate front end staff. Caused the FOH vs BOH war. Terrible for workplace standards and terrible leader. Entitled, thought he was the smartest person, bad stereotype of a manager. 

Tyler- Damions sidekick, some kind of anxious autistic drug addict. Conected to Damion at the hip. I once gave him a ride where he spent the whole ride on the phone with him like some kind of out of state girlfriend.
