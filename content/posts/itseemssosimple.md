## i cant be the only one who sees this

Just fire brittany, jamar, maya, carion, truett, kyle and then we've got rid of all the people who are a big negative impact on the culture. brit is too emotional and cant not talk shit unless shes completely stoned. Jamar is too emotional but in a different way, weird with breaks and snipping at the crew members. Zach and Ted are good, but Brit and Jamar are terrible managers for the culture. Brit does plenty of work but cant keep her mouth shut and picks the worst people to befriend. I have a feeling she sees a bit of herself in these people and wants to help them because shes compassionate, but they will fail her because no matter how much she wants them to succeed, they want to be scumbags, not work and try their hardest to get away with whatever they can. Jamar wants respect but he wont be able to get it because he doesnt respect himself or give anyone respect. So he pretends to be powerful so he can tell himself a story about how nobody respects him. They are defeating themselves with their actions. As managers they show everyone else how shitty you can be and still be employed here. 

Nobody really wants to be there. Thats why everyone is "sick" all the time. 

Just have everyone setup 3 interviews for the next week and we'll have enough people to try out. There isnt a way to attract good people, its just a dice roll. I want to implement agile, I'll pitch it this week.
