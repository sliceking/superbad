## whats the deal with expectation

Can I escape for 3 days. No expectations, no digging, no conditions. Leave me alone. I dont need you to tell me that you dont like my hair. I need you to leave me alone. Do you really care, can you really listen? How can I turn things around? I need to work out. I think it can be possible if I workout. we really ate shit the other day. The soundtrack is a little negative lately but fleeing for a better life isnt the best option all the time. Sometimes you gotta stick it out. Discrete changes will be just that. Dont trust the prison punishments during your lifetime. Execute. No right. No wrong. Preferrential treatement doesn't help. To become able you must give up on your abilities and surrender to the pain and turmoil of the path.
