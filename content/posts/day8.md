## Day 8. Burger mines.

Shelley day. Nothing about burgers except doing an errand to get extra large dome lids for the mines. Had to go to Round Rock store and it was kinda crappy there. They had the old floor that is super slippery, where you need the no slip shoes for sure. Followed by hiking and ski shores with the gals and pals for Shels bestalorette.
