## Johnny Terilli is sad

Some people can't accept things as they are. They need a reason. Their inability to go through life without being able
to tell themselves "I'm the best" is one of the glamorous causes of their problems. Lying to yourself, is an easy sport.
And its simple to win and convince yourself that your problems are so much worse than anyone else's. You are a great hero,
a paragon, a martyr. Any input that says otherwise is due to a problem that someone else is going through. Its not honest,
its them working through their problems. The levels of manipulation and trickery these people will employ on others and
themselves to protect their precious story is one of the more depressive patterns in the world. If only you would dogfood
the things you were trying to say. You'd probably be better. But you don't and you're too old to change.
