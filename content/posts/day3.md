## Day 3. Burger mines.

Andrew was there today and was whipping the shift pretty good. Things ran smoothly - bella is back which is kind of weird. She was a terrible worker and I think she's going to mostly just be cleaning tables and running food. I don't think shes capable of much more than that. Deontre was let go because he called out multiple times in his first 90 days. I went to the gym early morning and that felt good, did truck super fast and good. Tomorrow morning I have to be there early, 6 am. So deos that mean I workout at 430am or after work? Its gonna be rough the next two days. I think Friday I'm going to call in to be at Shelleys big farewell. I kind of have to. My foot is half out the door for the restaurant, I've started moving the pieces to jump ship and I feel like its about time. I will still put together my little pitch for agile and trello and just how the whole thing works. It will be turned down and ignored, but at least I will have said my piece and that is enough for me. I've tried talking to Eric to go to muay thai again and I think it shut him down again. Which sucks. 

Theres a level of pain involved in everything. Andrew seems like his health has gotten better, which is fantastic. If he can manage to whip things into shape that would be amazing. I just dont think it will happen. The staff is not animated about what anyone else has to say. Although I feel like a couple of the crew members have taken after me. Madison, Evelina, Aydin, Erika they have been/become outstanding. Being able to find something to do to stay busy at all times is really the best kind of employee at a fast food place. Juxtaposed with the unmotivated drone or the narcissist or the drama queens, the busy bee is by far the best of the lot.
