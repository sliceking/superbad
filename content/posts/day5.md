## Day 5. Burger mines.

Its a day off. Its gonna be bad tomorrow. I can feel it. Truck day is always bad. Itll definitely be a slog and probably a lot slower than getting the freezer and fridge done in 45 mins. Theres an interesting thing happening where there feels like there is some structure and orginization happening. This is coming from Andrew, and I wonder why its happening now. Why wasn't it happening before? Was he just giving everyone a chance to try and do something? Wasn't it obvious that nobody knew how to get things in order? Was he just a little too sick? So many questions. Why now? Why the wait? It feels like he's putting extra effort into Brittany which I think is a good decision. Even with her mood swings, out of everyone, she is the most deserving of upward mobility. Ted is still playing 38 laws of power, I overheard him talk with andrew about a previous workplace asking about him coming back. Ted also was sick a few days in a row the other week and "got some labs" done, which cost a bunch of money. So now he's doing a payday loan. That guy has always got some scheme going. Everything good that happens is because of him and everything bad is a result of his absense- what a wild imagination. I remember having that kind of framework when I was a child. Ugh. You can just be honest. You don't need to create some superhero alter ego, that's not real. Jamar is doing his stuff. I have no idea really I barely see him. I hope he's drinking less and dealing with the stress of the world in a healthy way. Zach I haven't seen much of lately either, I think he was moody the other day. There is a way to pull cod now. The floating rack is supposed to have the oldest bins. The still rack is supposed to be where you put the "new" stuff and when you pull, youre supposed to shift everything up. This is a process that will be ignored. Its so much effort and really you should just look at every sticker. Moving the bins is a lot of work.
