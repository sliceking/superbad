## Lying for good

I've been mulling ideas about lying over for a couple days. Telling the truth is the easiest way forward, generally, but
there are edge cases. Like the Japanese grandmother where her family knew she had fatal cancer and lied to her. They let 
her think she was healthy, so she wouldn't get sad and depressed and could live out her days without worrying about 
the things that come with a stage 4 diagnosis. I think she ended up living a couple years longer than was expected. Is
this a good lie? For her, maybe. If I was her family, I would have felt conflicted. I've been lied and been lied to 
plenty of times through omission and being on either side doesn't feel good. The spirit of the grandmother lie is good
but the follow through still results in bad feelings for family like me. That's expected, death is rough in any situation
but I'm not really convinced its good. There's a certain type of person and situation where it is the best, most moral
action but that situation probably wouldn't involve me. Lying for a good reason, and getting a good result - thats good.
Lying for a bad reason and getting a bad result - I suppose thats good in terms of expectations but the morality isn't.
The other variations good reason bad result/bad reason good result, are big problems. This isnt really going anywhere.
Life has gotten a lot simpler. A whole category of problems has been removed after choosing to be honest at all times,
even if you might hurt someone's feelings.
