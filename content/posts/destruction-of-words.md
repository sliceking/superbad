## Not convincing enough

Trying to convince someone not to lie is a rough game. Especially if the lies are to themselves. The amount of depression
and gaslighting that's come out of me trying to get my mother to be honest has been a challenge. It can't be done. 
Changing other people, if they don't want to, is impossible, and if its not then its probably through some illegal means.
I suppose I need to be more selfish. Not think about this. Just be a good person and not try to control anyone else, even
if I'm right, or trying to help or whatever reason I can come up with. Patience, honesty, serenity feel like easy goals 
until something pops up. There's always some event or topic or trigger where that goes out the window. If I ate better
I would be better, stress will take my appetite away and the lack of food will fuel my anxiety.
