## Day 1. Burger mines.

The day is rough. Things go smooth for a while. The change over form is my work, of course, there will be no assistance. This is normal. The trash, the dishes, set, the running, the cleaning, the pulling - all me. Thats ok. Things are not a problem if everyone else is actually doing their job. For whatever reason Alexis wants to be mean and does not want me to eat food that was double made. She got upset and worked up over this, I have a feeling she got embarassed halfway through and then decided to not do shit for the rest of the shift and avoid me. Maya also is lazy and just wants to say a bunch of things that she "cant do because shes too busy" ok I can do them, but shes just pointing out how much shes failing. Aside from being out of dress code with her nails for the week, she also is unhelpful and rude to guests typically more than once per shift. Brittany does well, she doesnt crash, we had 3 or 4 $1500 hours, which is a lot of work. I moved about 10 miles during the shift while Alexis and Maya were being rude children. Why do we keep them? Is it because she's got a kid? Alexis can do set and custard but she's dead set on trying to be a shitty person every other day. 

## there is no hope

Nobody is coming to save us. The best I can do is write out a plan and then pray the rest of the management team try to do some of it. a lot of it boils down to is andrew going to back this and if he doesnt, well, its not going to go anywhere. Using PM tools and having a plan, following through, are really the only way we can do this. The change will take work and then the follow through is simple, but getting buy in is most likely not going to happen. If I hire somebody I would like for them to be able to work and execute autonomously but theres this weirdness about trying to make things better by yourself. Its like the rest of the managers want andrews OK before doing something. Zach didnt want to try and teach the loop because he thought andrew wrote something up that he'd present at a meeting a month away. Which was enough reason, in his mind, to not try and make things better now. What? Why? He's probably the best manager we've got right now but he's kneecapping himself. You can just make things better. I feel like my strategy of, find the work people are avoiding, and then do it - is a pretty good stragety. It is thankless though. I do not go around looking for recognition or announcing the things I am doing. this is something Ted does that kind of botheres me. Theres a level of insecurity there, which, for him is necessary. He can play 38 laws of power all he wants, and he's not using it maliciously, which is good but it is very obvious and a little silly. Jamar has become invisible. Some newhires have already come and gone. Our culture is terrible. If I look in the slack there are pages of "not good enough" and I cant even remember the last time there was any praise. Culture comes from the top down and I can't change how the rest of the management team feels and interacts with themselves and the team. If I didn't exercise on Friday, I probably would have quit after Alexis was so rude. So I need to keep up the exercise, it did take the backseat for a while and when that happens life just feels terrible. To avoid the soul crushing weight of the Culvers of Georgetown management position, I need to keep up the exercise so I can do whats required to get through a day and not have the complaints of the team/public get me down. Andrew is very sensitive to online comments, which is a shame because giving the internet the keys to how you feel is a very dangerous way to operate, but I wont be the person to get him to change that.
