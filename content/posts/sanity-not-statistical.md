## There is a lot of feelings

After a huge failure last year of breaking down, going to rehab, quitting a great job, navigating an impossible family 
relationship, where do I find the motivation to do anything? Laying down and giving up is such an inviting idea. I've 
been trying to avoid using anger and frustration as a motivator. Could I move through the world on positive emotions? 
I can't, at least not right now. Most of my will is dedicated to trying not to go down negative mental rabbit holes that
lead to me doing nothing. If I can fight off the bad feelings then I can move - this way doesnt really work. When 
everything feels so negative its impossible to think myself out of it. One thing Ive learned is that the opposite is
true. A simple "fake it till you make it" attitude. Just act like you're happy, do the things a happy person would do
and then your thinking will follow you there over time. This is a weird point in time right now. I've just gotten off
anti-depressants and the access to more emotions has come back. Feelings like anger and frustration have replaced a
detatched, zombie-like ambivalence. As my brain levels back out, the emotions yo-yo just like when I first got on them.
Using negative feelings as motivation felt like a failure a couple weeks ago, but now what else am I supposed to do with
it? 


### What is the gasoline

Shame, anger, resentment. These have been the fuel in the past but I think they're unsuitable. Its hard not to use them
when people around you are trying to ***motivate*** you with them. This is a natural way people try to motivate others.
Use your anger and show them you are better, this is ego motivated. Which is a different kind of failure. Where is the
solution? If lack of care is the problem how is lack of care also the solution? Don't seek recognition of your value 
through others, don't listen to the negative voice inside, don't stop trying to do things, just do anything no matter
how small the progress bar moves as long as its moving.
