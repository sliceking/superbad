## I feel good

I'm surprised that things feel good. Work has been very good, lots of physical work but satisfying. Its so chaotic in the
restaurant, everyone is learning and trying to figure out the proper processes for everything. Its a mad house and I love
it. I _**do**_ need to find a programming job though. I'll want to keep doing this for the awesome food and custard and
everything fulfilling this job gives me, but I think realistically, I need that programmer money first. Maybe down the 
line I can give owning a Culver's a go, the pay for that is pretty good (300K-400K/yr) and its really a great company. 
People I've met from the support or national team were excellent people, and one girl Hailey was outstanding. Patient
teacher, had all the good manager qualities, and also very attractive. She's just become an owner at a store in Iowa 
someplace.

## check in

I try and make sure to check in with myself pretty regularly. Its only been a week but there's a few times when I've 
asked myself "Do I really enjoy this?" because I've been known to be a good self liar. This is one of the things I hate
that my mom does, and she is a pro at it, but I realize that it's a reflection of things I don't like about myself as well.
In my last job it was after I quit, where my therapist told me "You really didn't like that job" and I was a bit shocked.
I had been telling myself it was so great the entire time but after, when she said that, it clicked. I was trying to
convince myself I liked it. Lying to yourself is a weird thing, a two-edged sword. You can do some great things with it
and at the same time, live in a delusion. A non reality where your judgement is terrible from all the things you've 
convinced yourself of. So I try to think about it and attempt to live in good old-fashioned regular reality.
