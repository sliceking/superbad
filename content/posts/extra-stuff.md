## The back of house is crazy but simple to be focused

The past few weeks I've been doing the truck, learning porter, grill, sandwiches and office work. Also taking temps and
doing other assorted paperwork needed to run the restaurant daily, and freezer pulls. Doing truck is hard some days
because youre in a -10deg freezer.

## things to do
131 principle. one problem, three solutions, one recommendation. 80/20 rule for standup, staff talk for 80 of the time
management speaks 20. curiosity, systems and goals, measurement. So I think I'm going to implement standups, 4 mins.
Ask about the previous service, ask about today and problems and solutions and focus. Ask about things they did wrong
and what they should do to avoid that, talk about accountability. See if this has an impact over the next week and if it
does then bring it up for everyone(managers) to implement. Invite them in for it.
