## Day 4. Burger mines.

Andrew did a good job getting a lot of people working from a list. Madison on set, Aydin on middle/ low sales day but great for Aydin and his practice on middle. I got help from brittany for the shift change work, which was great. That all felt pretty good. If things can move at a pace like this it will feel like this are moving in a good direction, but I cant get my hopes up. I need to be practicing and applying to programming jobs. Things have gotten depressing enough that I need to get back to my money roots.
