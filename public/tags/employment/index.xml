      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-think-this-is-the-thing-to-do&#34;&gt;I think this is the thing to do&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t had a job for over a year and I think Culver&amp;rsquo;s just hired me. This is going to be an interesting ride. I&#xA;remember feeling a kind of pride for not having worked a fast food job in the past. Is this a success? It doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel&#xA;like it. This is going to be a wide cast of characters, kids in high school, 60 year olds, lots of attitudes and hungry&#xA;grumps. Good thing I have access to emotions like anger and frustration again. Typically, I&amp;rsquo;m a very patient person and&#xA;this doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like it will be a problem, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know everything, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been wrong before. Having something&#xA;to do while getting my programming chops back is a benefit and I suppose that is a victory. The past year has been a&#xA;lot of emotions and stagnation. An inability to move anything. This is movement. That&amp;rsquo;s good. It&amp;rsquo;s something.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
