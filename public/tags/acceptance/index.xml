      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-back-of-house-is-crazy-but-simple-to-be-focused&#34;&gt;The back of house is crazy but simple to be focused&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The past few weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing the truck, learning porter, grill, sandwiches and office work. Also taking temps and&#xA;doing other assorted paperwork needed to run the restaurant daily, and freezer pulls. Doing truck is hard some days&#xA;because youre in a -10deg freezer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;things-to-do&#34;&gt;things to do&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;131 principle. one problem, three solutions, one recommendation. 80/20 rule for standup, staff talk for 80 of the time&#xA;management speaks 20. curiosity, systems and goals, measurement. So I think I&amp;rsquo;m going to implement standups, 4 mins.&#xA;Ask about the previous service, ask about today and problems and solutions and focus. Ask about things they did wrong&#xA;and what they should do to avoid that, talk about accountability. See if this has an impact over the next week and if it&#xA;does then bring it up for everyone(managers) to implement. Invite them in for it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;johnny-terilli-is-sad&#34;&gt;Johnny Terilli is sad&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some people can&amp;rsquo;t accept things as they are. They need a reason. Their inability to go through life without being able&#xA;to tell themselves &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m the best&amp;rdquo; is one of the glamorous causes of their problems. Lying to yourself, is an easy sport.&#xA;And its simple to win and convince yourself that your problems are so much worse than anyone else&amp;rsquo;s. You are a great hero,&#xA;a paragon, a martyr. Any input that says otherwise is due to a problem that someone else is going through. Its not honest,&#xA;its them working through their problems. The levels of manipulation and trickery these people will employ on others and&#xA;themselves to protect their precious story is one of the more depressive patterns in the world. If only you would dogfood&#xA;the things you were trying to say. You&amp;rsquo;d probably be better. But you don&amp;rsquo;t and you&amp;rsquo;re too old to change.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-was-the-problem&#34;&gt;What was the problem?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where was my drive to do anything? It was gone for about a year and now in a week its fallen into an appropriate position.&#xA;The only change was picking up a fast food job, which at first felt like a failure. But now it feels great, amazing&#xA;even. I can&amp;rsquo;t remember a time when I didn&amp;rsquo;t care about my job at all in this way. Not the way of &amp;ldquo;I dont care about it&#xA;so I won&amp;rsquo;t try to achieve&amp;rdquo;, but I don&amp;rsquo;t have any fear about the work, the people, any interaction. Any anxieties have&#xA;been replaced with a soaring confidence. The work is not difficult. I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to find a way to have fun in the&#xA;monotony and improve on parts of myself that I&amp;rsquo;d been neglecting. The job feels like a project. A side quest. Something&#xA;for the thrill of the experience. Which is a pretty good way to frame it. It would be so easy to judge myself as a failure&#xA;and the fast food job as proof. But I&amp;rsquo;ve done that a thousand times already. The past year of living in the void was&#xA;enough time to beat myself to death and then try not to. I&amp;rsquo;ll start with a slackbot to help people reschedule shifts.&#xA;And then if they like that, maybe theres other little things I can do to make the place better. Its so weird. I used&#xA;to have a bit of pride that I didn&amp;rsquo;t work a fast food job. That didn&amp;rsquo;t help much of anything though.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Cat Feelings</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;not-having-a-job&#34;&gt;Not having a job&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My cat is big. Not really fat, just big. Big boned I suppose and about twenty pounds. A buff, which is another term for&#xA;light orange, American short-hair. The other week I spent a couple of days cat sitting for my friend and I got to spend&#xA;a lot of quality time with their cat. Her name was Surreal. She was a sweet, cuddly indoor/outdoor cat who knew that I&#xA;was her friend and a welcome source of petting, playing, love and affection. It was great. As far as cat software goes&#xA;she had some A+ cat code installed. Its always funny when I spend time around other cats, then come home to my cat and&#xA;remember how much of a monster she is compared to regular cats. Not quite Maine Coon, but still, quite enough. Nala, my&#xA;cat, is skittish, a big scaredy. She doesn&amp;rsquo;t trust anyone except me, which makes me feel special and its sort of&#xA;endearing, but I wish she would be more confident. This is a criticism I&amp;rsquo;ve heard made about me in recent years and,&#xA;yeah, I wish so too. I can remember the overflowing confidence of my 20s and I just don&amp;rsquo;t feel that way anymore. Sure&#xA;I can fake it, but being honest is so much easier. I dont want to trick people into liking a &amp;lsquo;for show&amp;rsquo; version of&#xA;myself. Did I teach my cat my un-confidence? That cant be possible, could it? I don&amp;rsquo;t think so. I remember taking her to&#xA;the vet during covid and one trip changed her attitude forever. She &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;WAS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; a confident and fearless kitten. Curious&#xA;and wild, but after the one trip to the vet she was so afraid. I used to be able to touch her hands and cut her nails and&#xA;now cutting her nails is impossible. During covid you had to drop your animal outisde the door of the vet and then come&#xA;back an hourish later to pick them up. I feel like if I was able to go inside and be with her in the vet this wouldnt have&#xA;happened. As a scared cat I still love her, but I wish she would demand pets, I wish I could carry her and that awkward&#xA;sounds wouldnt set her off. I&amp;rsquo;ve done a lot to try to un-shy her. Maybe she needs a little friend, a brother or a sister&#xA;to show her the ways of wild cat youth. To inspire her to relax and open up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I can&#39;t think myself into good acting but I can act myself into good thinking.</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;betrayal-and-character-assassination&#34;&gt;Betrayal and character assassination&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why do people punish themselves? Pride. Sometimes in weird places, sometimes in obvious ones. Write from the scar, not&#xA;from the wound. Itll be too emotional if its from an open wound. Thats pretty good advice. Getting away for a few days&#xA;is great to reflect and figure out what I&amp;rsquo;m doing with myself. Its been a lot of nothing, starving, depression. Not good.&#xA;Having someone to yell at you and rile you up is a strange bonus. I can use any negative feelings as fuel to get things&#xA;done, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to avoid that for a while. Can&amp;rsquo;t I find enough positive emotions to use as a motivation&#xA;source? It doesnt look like it, at least not right now. It was a decent experiment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>It&#39;s a beautiful thing, the destruction of words</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;not-convincing-enough&#34;&gt;Not convincing enough&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Trying to convince someone not to lie is a rough game. Especially if the lies are to themselves. The amount of depression&#xA;and gaslighting that&amp;rsquo;s come out of me trying to get my mother to be honest has been a challenge. It can&amp;rsquo;t be done.&#xA;Changing other people, if they don&amp;rsquo;t want to, is impossible, and if its not then its probably through some illegal means.&#xA;I suppose I need to be more selfish. Not think about this. Just be a good person and not try to control anyone else, even&#xA;if I&amp;rsquo;m right, or trying to help or whatever reason I can come up with. Patience, honesty, serenity feel like easy goals&#xA;until something pops up. There&amp;rsquo;s always some event or topic or trigger where that goes out the window. If I ate better&#xA;I would be better, stress will take my appetite away and the lack of food will fuel my anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Who controls the past.</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-have-too-many-expectations-of-my-mom&#34;&gt;I have too many expectations of my mom&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Shes getting old and her judgement is beginning to go. The other month she was sure she&amp;rsquo;d been texting Elon Musk and he&#xA;was waiting on her gift cards so he could finish delivering a Tesla and 100K to her. Part of me is fighting with her,&#xA;trying to reason things out with her to show her how to watch out for traps like this. Another part is fighting reality,&#xA;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to admit that her thinking is so compromised. That its just going to get harder for her to understand me.&#xA;She&amp;rsquo;s doing it too, she&amp;rsquo;s fighting the fact she&amp;rsquo;s going to die, that her thinking has gotten worse, constantly telling&#xA;herself she&amp;rsquo;s not as bad as someone else in the Assisted Living Facility. It must be terrible to be in your 70s and be&#xA;afraid of death and aging. Knowing that your father and sister suffered from dementia and that you are next in line. If&#xA;I don&amp;rsquo;t think about it then its not happening. I wish that were the case. I wish I could do something to remove her&#xA;insecurities, find her some friends, stop her from judging herself and others. She&amp;rsquo;s been alone too long and her pride&#xA;is being used to keep her ego afloat. I can just try to show her I love her, even though she won&amp;rsquo;t understand it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
