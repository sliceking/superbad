      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;johnny-terilli-is-sad&#34;&gt;Johnny Terilli is sad&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some people can&amp;rsquo;t accept things as they are. They need a reason. Their inability to go through life without being able&#xA;to tell themselves &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m the best&amp;rdquo; is one of the glamorous causes of their problems. Lying to yourself, is an easy sport.&#xA;And its simple to win and convince yourself that your problems are so much worse than anyone else&amp;rsquo;s. You are a great hero,&#xA;a paragon, a martyr. Any input that says otherwise is due to a problem that someone else is going through. Its not honest,&#xA;its them working through their problems. The levels of manipulation and trickery these people will employ on others and&#xA;themselves to protect their precious story is one of the more depressive patterns in the world. If only you would dogfood&#xA;the things you were trying to say. You&amp;rsquo;d probably be better. But you don&amp;rsquo;t and you&amp;rsquo;re too old to change.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
