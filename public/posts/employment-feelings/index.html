<p>My cat is big. Not really fat, just big. Big boned I suppose and about twenty pounds. A buff, which is another term for
light orange, American short-hair. The other week I spent a couple of days cat sitting for my friend and I got to spend
a lot of quality time with their cat. Her name was Surreal. She was a sweet, cuddly indoor/outdoor cat who knew that I
was her friend and a welcome source of petting, playing, love and affection. It was great. As far as cat software goes
she had some A+ cat code installed. Its always funny when I spend time around other cats, then come home to my cat and
remember how much of a monster she is compared to regular cats. Not quite Maine Coon, but still, quite enough. Nala, my
cat, is skittish, a big scaredy. She doesn&rsquo;t trust anyone except me, which makes me feel special and its sort of
endearing, but I wish she would be more confident. This is a criticism I&rsquo;ve heard made about me in recent years and,
yeah, I wish so too. I can remember the overflowing confidence of my 20s and I just don&rsquo;t feel that way anymore. Sure
I can fake it, but being honest is so much easier. I dont want to trick people into liking a &lsquo;for show&rsquo; version of
myself. Did I teach my cat my un-confidence? That cant be possible, could it? I don&rsquo;t think so. I remember taking her to
the vet during covid and one trip changed her attitude forever. She <strong><em>WAS</em></strong> a confident and fearless kitten. Curious
and wild, but after the one trip to the vet she was so afraid. I used to be able to touch her hands and cut her nails and
now cutting her nails is impossible. During covid you had to drop your animal outisde the door of the vet and then come
back an hourish later to pick them up. I feel like if I was able to go inside and be with her in the vet this wouldnt have
happened. As a scared cat I still love her, but I wish she would demand pets, I wish I could carry her and that awkward
sounds wouldnt set her off. I&rsquo;ve done a lot to try to un-shy her. Maybe she needs a little friend, a brother or a sister
to show her the ways of wild cat youth. To inspire her to relax and open up.</p>
