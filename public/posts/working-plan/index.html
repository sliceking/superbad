      <h2 id="i-think-this-is-the-thing-to-do">I think this is the thing to do</h2>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t had a job for over a year and I think Culver&rsquo;s just hired me. This is going to be an interesting ride. I
remember feeling a kind of pride for not having worked a fast food job in the past. Is this a success? It doesn&rsquo;t feel
like it. This is going to be a wide cast of characters, kids in high school, 60 year olds, lots of attitudes and hungry
grumps. Good thing I have access to emotions like anger and frustration again. Typically, I&rsquo;m a very patient person and
this doesn&rsquo;t feel like it will be a problem, but I don&rsquo;t know everything, and I&rsquo;ve been wrong before. Having something
to do while getting my programming chops back is a benefit and I suppose that is a victory. The past year has been a
lot of emotions and stagnation. An inability to move anything. This is movement. That&rsquo;s good. It&rsquo;s something.</p>
<h2 id="johnny">Johnny</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;ll be talking to him again. He knows he has a big ego, but from my perspective it doesn&rsquo;t feel like
he&rsquo;s doing a lot to kill it. I know this isn&rsquo;t true and I about wonder what he was like before this period in his life.
I&rsquo;ve gotten tired of him patting himself on the back every time he tells a story.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let me tell you about my step-son, IOPs are terrible, my real son is so much better because I&rsquo;m a better dad than my
step-sons, if anyone talks about an IOP I&rsquo;ll tell them about my step-son, look at how much other people suffer, if
only Terry was more like me he wouldn&rsquo;t be in this mess, Ed is so sad let me tell you why, these peoples shares are
all wrong, I gotta do security in the dumbest way possible because I thought of it and it&rsquo;s the best, i let myself
suffer because I&rsquo;m helping people, that girl got killed by some idiot but I&rsquo;ll blame me, I lied to my wife in my
amends because she needed it, I helped the therapist with her problems means I&rsquo;m better than a therapist, I know
everything wrong with everyone let me tell you about it and pad my statements with &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not perfect, I don&rsquo;t know
everything&rdquo; so I don&rsquo;t sound too conceited</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let it go! If you&rsquo;re a bad story detector you won&rsquo;t find any good ones. You&rsquo;re avoiding talking about the failures, the
real emotional failures and you&rsquo;re in no way a martyr you just love telling yourself that you are. There are no bombers
that are scared of you, pure delusion, and stop talking shit about everyone after a meeting. They talked about what they
needed to, stop judging them. If there was a real after-meeting with a caring environment, instead of telling some girl
to shut the fuck up and acceptance and higher power everything - That would help. Lying about how you&rsquo;re feeling until
you&rsquo;re better, doesn&rsquo;t. People kill themselves from not having an honest emotional outlet. Doing a sharetime performance
gets you nowhere. If you don&rsquo;t say all the buzzwords you&rsquo;re supposed to I&rsquo;ll look down on you from 30 years of
doing things my own way. You don&rsquo;t get to choose, everyone is a statesman <strong><em>AND</em></strong> a deacon. The listeners decide.</p>
